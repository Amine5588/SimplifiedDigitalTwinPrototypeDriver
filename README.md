# Car model And Behvaviour - MATLAB APP
The carmodel_and_behaviour_exported MATLAB App, developed in MATLAB App Designer, provides an interactive interface to simulate and visualize the dynamic behavior of a simplified car model. This application implements a first-order model to analyze car speed under varying parameters, including mass (500–2000 kg), friction (0–1000 Nms), engine power (0–50 kW), road slope (-20 to 20 degrees), and wind velocity (0–20 m/s). Users can adjust these parameters via intuitive sliders, triggering real-time animations of the car’s movement on a graphical plot and detailed analyses of speed responses. As shown in the accompanying visualization ![Car model and behaviour](https://github.com/Amine5588/SimplifiedDigitalTwinPrototypeDriver/blob/main/gui_matlab.png), the app displays a top panel with an animated car traversing a road under wind influences (blue for car, red for road, green for steady-state speed), alongside lower panels showing time constant and gain modeling (e.g., T = 1.6 s, steady-state = 60 m/s) and stored step responses under different parameter combinations. This tool serves as a robust foundation for vehicle dynamics research, though it currently relies on manual user input rather than an autonomous driver model.

# SIMULINK Model (car_suspension_control101.slx)
"The car_suspension_control101.slx SIMULINK model, integrated with MATLAB scripts, visualizes and analyzes the suspension behavior of a car using a mass-spring-damper system. This model simulates the displacement of the car chassis and wheel under varying road profiles, represented by a ground profile input (e.g., step or ramp disturbances). Key parameters include mass (500–700 kg), spring constants (7500–170000 N/m), damping (1250–5500 N.s/m), and vehicle velocity (10–20 m/s), allowing systematic investigation of suspension dynamics. The MATLAB script accompanying the model defines these parameters, runs the simulation, and generates plots to compare wheel, ground, and car displacement over time, as demonstrated in figures for nominal conditions, speed changes, and optimized damping scenarios (e.g., reducing oscillation by increasing damping from 1250 to 5500 N.s/m). These visualizations, such as overlaid plots of car movement under different conditions, provide critical insights into suspension performance, complementing the MATLAB app by focusing on vehicle dynamics but not yet incorporating driver behavior."

# driver behavior EDA, modeling, and fine-tuning using ML and DL approaches (Jupyter Notebook Implementation) 
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Processing
In The Jupyter Notebook for driver behavior analysis we conduct an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data processing pipeline to model driving patterns using sensor data (acceleration and gyroscope measurements) from train_motion_data.csv and test_motion_data.csv. The dataset, containing 3,084 training and 3,644 testing samples with features like AccX, AccY, AccZ, GyroX, GyroY, GyroZ, Class, and Timestamp, was analyzed for continuity, outliers, and signal characteristics. Key findings include approximately two measurements per second, balanced class distribution (SLOW, NORMAL, AGGRESSIVE), and significant disagreement in acceleration data, mitigated using statistical methods like Bland-Altman plots and normalization. Data augmentation ensured signal continuity, while denoising techniques (rolling average, exponential smoothing, Gaussian filter) were applied, visualized through time-series plots and spectral analyses (FFT, spectrograms) for each class, revealing distinct frequency patterns. These visualizations, such as boxplots of sensor differences and spectrograms per driving style, provide critical insights into driver behavior, setting the foundation for predictive modeling.
## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Driver Behavior Prediction
The notebook implements a comprehensive suite of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict driver behaviors, specifically classifying aggressive vs. non-aggressive driving using PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras. ML models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost, achieved accuracies ranging from 67% to 74% and balanced accuracies from 58% to 67%, with Random Forest reaching 74% accuracy but struggling with recall for the minority class due to imbalance. DL models, such as MLP, CNN (using recurrence plots for image-based classification), and RNN (LSTM, GRU), were developed to handle sequential sensor data, with architectures like a three-layer LSTM achieving up to 78% accuracy, 76% balanced accuracy, 62% precision, and 71% recall, outperforming simpler models. Hyperparameter tuning via RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV optimized an LSTM model, yielding a best configuration with 14 units in the first layer, 23 in the second, 0.3 dropout, 0.01 learning rate, and 0.8 decay rate, achieving a mean test accuracy of 71% and AUC of 70% over 5-fold cross-validation. Visualizations, including loss/accuracy plots and confusion matrices, highlight model performance, addressing challenges like class imbalance (handled with class weights) and data noise, though integration with the MATLAB/SIMULINK or Python self-driving car remains a future step.
