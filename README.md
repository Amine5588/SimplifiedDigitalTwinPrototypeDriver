# Car model And Behvaviour - MATLAB APP
The carmodel_and_behaviour_exported MATLAB App, developed in MATLAB App Designer, provides an interactive interface to simulate and visualize the dynamic behavior of a simplified car model. This application implements a first-order model to analyze car speed under varying parameters, including mass (500–2000 kg), friction (0–1000 Nms), engine power (0–50 kW), road slope (-20 to 20 degrees), and wind velocity (0–20 m/s). Users can adjust these parameters via intuitive sliders, triggering real-time animations of the car’s movement on a graphical plot and detailed analyses of speed responses. As shown in the accompanying visualization (image.png), the app displays a top panel with an animated car traversing a road under wind influences (blue for car, red for road, green for steady-state speed), alongside lower panels showing time constant and gain modeling (e.g., T = 1.6 s, steady-state = 60 m/s) and stored step responses under different parameter combinations. This tool serves as a robust foundation for vehicle dynamics research, though it currently relies on manual user input rather than an autonomous driver model.

# SIMULINK Model (car_suspension_control101.slx)
"The car_suspension_control101.slx SIMULINK model, integrated with MATLAB scripts, visualizes and analyzes the suspension behavior of a car using a mass-spring-damper system. This model simulates the displacement of the car chassis and wheel under varying road profiles, represented by a ground profile input (e.g., step or ramp disturbances). Key parameters include mass (500–700 kg), spring constants (7500–170000 N/m), damping (1250–5500 N.s/m), and vehicle velocity (10–20 m/s), allowing systematic investigation of suspension dynamics. The MATLAB script accompanying the model defines these parameters, runs the simulation, and generates plots to compare wheel, ground, and car displacement over time, as demonstrated in figures for nominal conditions, speed changes, and optimized damping scenarios (e.g., reducing oscillation by increasing damping from 1250 to 5500 N.s/m). These visualizations, such as overlaid plots of car movement under different conditions, provide critical insights into suspension performance, complementing the MATLAB app by focusing on vehicle dynamics but not yet incorporating driver behavior."
